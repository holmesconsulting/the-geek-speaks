Most companies think they know exactly what their product should be. And in many ways, that makes sense—they're experts in their domain. They’ve built their reputation on deep subject matter expertise. But here’s the hard truth: **they’re not the end users of their product.**

That gap between what you *think* users need and what they *actually* need is where so many products go sideways. Features get built that no one uses. Design choices confuse rather than help. Engineering teams burn cycles on things that don’t move the needle.

That’s why **discovery sprints are the best tool most companies don’t even know they should use.**

## 💡 What Is a Discovery Sprint?

A discovery sprint is an **8–12 week, time-boxed collaboration** among a small cross-functional team—engineers, designers, product owners, and subject experts—working closely with the organization. The goal isn’t to jump into solutions, but to **identify root causes, surface challenges, and uncover user needs** through stakeholder interviews, system reviews, and real-world observation.

In short, it’s **structured learning before committing to code**—a way to ensure you're solving the right problem before you start building.

## Why Discovery Sprints Work

Having led and participated in many discovery sprints, I can confidently say—they **always shape the future product**, even when they reveal unexpected findings. Especially then. Here’s why:

- **They align teams around real user needs.** You’re not guessing—you’re observing, listening, and validating early.  
- **They surface assumptions.** Hidden beliefs emerge early, allowing teams to pivot or refine direction before investing heavily.  
- **They reduce risk.** Discovery provides clarity on what to build, helping teams avoid costly missteps.  
- **They build momentum.** In a matter of weeks, teams gain shared understanding and direction rooted in evidence.

## Federal and State Experience

I’ve had the opportunity to work on discovery sprints at both the **federal** and **state** levels—where the stakes are high, and the complexity is real. I’ve helped shape product direction and modernization strategy through sprints at:

- **The Department of Veterans Affairs**, supporting improved digital services for millions of veterans.  
- **The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, helping uncover opportunities for more effective health data systems.  
- **The State of California**, where I supported their **Technology Modernization Fund** and the **Project Approval Lifecycle** process—critical initiatives aimed at improving how the state procures and modernizes technology.

These engagements proved again and again that discovery isn’t a “nice to have”—it’s essential to meaningful, impactful, user-centered product development.

## Expertise ≠ End-User Insight

One of the biggest mistakes teams make is assuming that subject matter expertise automatically means user insight. It doesn’t. Expertise helps define the space, but empathy drives good product decisions.

Discovery sprints are how we bridge that gap. Through structured research, user interviews, and rapid prototyping, we turn assumptions into understanding—and insight into action.
