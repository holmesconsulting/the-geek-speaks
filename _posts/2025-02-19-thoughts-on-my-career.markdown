subtitle: Impact and people are what matter not technology
---

Thirty years in technology is more than just a career, it is a lifetime of learning and changes in opinions. My journey started at the help desk at the State of New York, troubleshooting problems for frustrated users in the welfare system and learning the foundational skills of IT support. My role evolved towards network engineering and then field technical lead rolling out a client server application and training the staff in the field. The next transition was large scale IT support and management of applications across the City of New York as an Enterprise Citrix System Administrator and then Network Operations Center Manager.  I then transitioned into web development realizing that web technologies are a way to democratize and allow everyone to access content via technology, I created many solutions and websites as an individual contributor, led teams of engineers, worked in government service to modernize systems, and ultimately became a business owner. At every stage, one thing remained constant: the drive to serve, solve problems, and create impact.  This is the story of that journey, the lessons learned along the way, and the insights I hope will help others navigate their own career paths.

Like many in technology, my career began at the help desk and bounced around the city and state of New York where I supported large scale, enterprise IT systems. Supporting users meant more than just fixing computers and systems and it also meant listening, diagnosing problems, and building trust. Every call and ticket was an opportunity to learn, not just about technical issues, but about the people using the systems. These roles taught me invaluable lessons:
- How to translate technical jargon into plain language.
- The importance of empathy and patience when working with frustrated users.
- That technology is only useful if it serves the people using it.

These early experiences shaped my understanding of what good technology delivery and support looks like and was something that would guide me throughout my career.  As I became a technology and open source community organizer I was truly influenced by these learnings where I realized my super power was helping non-technical folks understand technical concepts by meeting them where they are and helping technical folks learn how to communicate with folks who are less technical.

From troubleshooting small and large scale technical issues, I moved into web development, shifting from fixing problems to building solutions. Writing code 
 and creating products gave me the power to create, automate, and solve challenges in new ways.  In this phase, I learned:
- The balance between technical perfection and delivering value. Sometimes, getting a product in users' hands quickly is more important than optimizing every line of code.
- The importance of maintainable, scalable solutions. A well-written application is not just about working today, but being adaptable for the future.
- That collaboration is key. Development isn’t just about the code: it’s about working with designers, product owners, and users to ensure the right problems are being solved.
- While I enjoyed the craft of coding, I also began to see a bigger picture: success wasn't just about building software; it was about enabling teams to build the right software that solved the end users problems.

As I grew in my career, I moved into leadership roles, helping teams of developers navigate the complexities of delivering software across complicated and difficult environments. The transition from individual contributor to technical leader required a shift in mindset, instead of focusing on writing the code myself, my priority became creating an environment where others could do their best work.  Realizing that when we deliver solutions to users of the solutions that are solving real issues and it was done by teams that you lead, mentor and train that their success is what you are working towards.  You need to shift from a me to a we perspective, where helping others deliver is what you are driven by, leaving behind the spotlight to focus on the overall delivery and happiness of the clients and end users.  My time at the United States Digital Service (USDS) was particularly transformative, I was thrust into an organization full of folks that were empathetic and focused on the end users the way that I was throughout my career. Working in government technology, I saw firsthand how the systems we work on affected millions of people and the mission was clear: modernize critical services to improve lives.  In this phase, I learned:
- Technology isn’t the hardest part of modernization, that culture and bureaucracy are more intransigent, you can update systems and solutions but changing the minds of the folks in charge from middle management to the Secretary's office was the real job. Leading change requires learning from subject matter experts, breaking down silos, earning trust from the folks on the front lines to leadership, and proving value and impact through results.
- Good leadership is about amplifying others success and taking on the worry and concern to free folks of their burdens. Helping teams stay focused, removing and clearing blockers, and supporting their growth leads to better outcomes for everyone involved.
- Public interest technology and CivicTech work is hard but deeply rewarding. Seeing the direct impact of technical improvements on real people’s lives reinforced why I got into technology in the first place.

Eventually, I took everything I had learned and channeled it into building a business, initially to support my local county. My focus shifted from working within organizations to supporting businesses in delivering on their contracts and creating meaningful impact for their clients.  This is just an extension of my time at USDS where I was able to work across government, at many agencies in my 4 years, when I left government my greatest worry was that I wouldn't be able to have to the large scale impact that I had.  The work I am doing today allows me to work with diverse companies across many industries helping them delivery for their clients and users, grow and mentor technical leaders and be an honest broker and advisor to executives supporting their companies goals.  Entrepreneurship came with its own set of lessons:
- Execution matters more than ideas and that success isn’t just about having great strategies, it’s about ensuring they’re implemented effectively.
- People are still the most important part of any solution, the best tools and processes mean nothing without the right people executing the vision and delivering value.
- For me impact-driven work is the most fulfilling, whether I am working with government agencies, nonprofits, or private businesses. I have found the greatest satisfaction in helping organizations solve real problems for real people.

For anyone charting their own path in technology, my biggest advice is this: have strong opinions held loosely, be open to learning and changing your opinions and biases, and above all else stay focused on impact. Businesses, technology and ecosystems change constantly, but the need for real problem solvers, leaders, and mission-driven people will always remain. No matter where you are in your career, whether at a help desk, coding your first app, leading a team, or thinking about starting your own business, remember that the best work happens when you put people first. Technology is just the tool. Impact is the goal.

If my journey resonates with you, I’d love to connect. Let’s build, lead, and create meaningful change together.
