Lots has changed since my last post.  I am a business owner, a married man, a home owner but I still a geek of many feathers.  My business [Holmes Consulting Group Inc.](https://holmesconsulting.group/) was founded in 2021 when I was in discussion with [Prince William County](https://www.pwcva.gov/) to become their Director of Digital Services and Software Engineering.  It was quicker to come into the county as a consultant and begin the work ASAP that the CIO was trying to accomplish so rather then use someone else's company I founded my own.  I have been lucky enough to be successful in this business endeavour and refine my offerings to focus on continuing to drive impact in the digital service delivery space now supporting government contacting companies in their engagements.  This role came about because my wife, [Amy Edwards Holmes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-edwards-holmes/) watched me struggle through knee surgery and rehab in our rental townhouse in Alexandria and was determined to help future Robbie by finding us a ranch style home.  Well she did and in 2021 we bought our home in Manassas VA and after that I checked out the local government and was moved to apply. After a year I decided to move away from the county, the pandemic was still in full effect and the resources weren't there to kickstart the digital service delivery organization that I had envisioned.  In this time period I also kickstarted a true passion project [Geek On Film](https://geekonfilm.com/), I have been a budding cinephile for years and now I was able to take it more seriously by both writing reviews and recording podcasts.  Initially the podcast was co-hosted by [Jon Hoche](https://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Jon-Hoche/) and I, it was a way for me to recapture the conversations that we had on my couch over the years and be able to keep up with my friend from afar.  Since the podcast started Jon has become a father of an amazing little man named Hudson, been a puppeteer on Apple TV+'s [Hello Tomorrow!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14596212/), reprised his role as Audrey 2 in Little Shop of Horrors off-broadway and on broadway as part of the [Life of Pi](https://lifeofpibway.com/) as a memeber of the squad of puppeteers and now on the SAG tour of the same show as the Resident Director, U.S. Associate Puppetry & Movement Director and sometimes swing!  So to say he's a bit busy is true, but I am so proud of him and have kept the podcast alive, now it is less a conversation and one geek's thoughts on film ðŸ˜Š.
